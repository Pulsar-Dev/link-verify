# Pulsar Link Verify
Pulsar Link Verify is the verification site for the Pulsar Link project.
It allows users to link their Discord and Steam accounts to their Gmodstore account
and then link them all together to a Pulsar ID using the Pulsar Link Backend.
It is designed to be used with the rest of the Pulsar Link project and will not function without it.
